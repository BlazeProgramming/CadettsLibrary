# EffectsByCadett
## Description
This is a library built by Cadett to help add inline styling through the medium of JS. It'll also include a way of keyframing animations with ease through JS. All with the proper vendor prefixes. All is 100% jQuery compatible too.

## Help Needed
This library is currently under development. If you would like to help, feel free to fork this repo and send pull requests my way. All help is appreciated.

Some things that you can specifically help with:
* keyframe keywords? Are there any others than the position and the percentage?
* Inclusion of CSS? How in the world do I get documents to accept them in a link? I already tried `<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="blahblahblahiforget">`
